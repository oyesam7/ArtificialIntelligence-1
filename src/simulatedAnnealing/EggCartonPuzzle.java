/**
 * The Egg Carton Puzzle
 * <p>
 * A farmer has a rectangular egg carton consisting of M rows and N columns of
 * cells, where each cell can hold one egg. The task is simply to place as many
 * eggs as possible into the carton without violating the following constraint:
 * No row, column nor diagonal can contain more than K eggs.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Puzzle Variants (all of which you must attempt):
 * <p>
 * <li>1. M=N=5andK=2
 * <li>2. M=N=6andK=2
 * <li>3. M = N = 8 and K = 1 (Does this problem look familiar?) 4. M=N=10andK=3
